Crashes for Adobe Acrobat

For Userland Crashes, the Return of:
```
(5980.630): Security check failure or stack buffer overrun - code c0000409 (first/second chance not available)
Subcode: 0x7 FAST_FAIL_FATAL_APP_EXIT 
```

That is translated to, for Userland, the Application Bailed out as expected, probably nothing to see here..
